Pathogenesis is a platform-based puzzle game where you control a vulnerable virus striving to survive in a microscopic world.
&lt;br>
As the player traverses through levels, they must solve puzzles by infecting organisms and manipulating their environment in a mysterious and perilous land.

&lt;br>
An &lt;strong>adventure game&lt;/strong> featuring both &lt;strong>combat and puzzles&lt;/strong> for two players, where you control two mages working together to fight their way through the newly-formed Minion Union.
&lt;p>&lt;br>Designed to be &lt;strong>accessible&lt;/strong> for both experienced and casual players, the game blends humor, satire, and chaos. Each character has a unique combat style and abilities—one focuses on melee combat and brute force, while the other specializes in ranged combat and strategic play.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DM Vault - WIP</title><link>https://mazafrav.github.io/posts/dmvault/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mazafrav.github.io/posts/dmvault/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="about">About&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>This battle encounter was created for a group of friends new to TTRPGs.
&lt;br>&lt;br>Initially designed as a friendly encounter, it was reworked into a tutorial to teach the importance of cover and line of sight.
&lt;br>&lt;br>The group consists mostly of ranged spellcasters, so I set up a map with trees as cover and ranged enemies. The enemy team is led by an angry dryad who teleports between trees, forcing the players to search for her while hiding.
&lt;br>&lt;br>Four awakened shrubs ambush once the dryad spots the players. The dryad attacks those not using cover, encouraging repositioning.
&lt;br>&lt;br>This also serves as an introduction to a later boss fight with a teleporting witch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>FPS Level Design study - WIP</title><link>https://mazafrav.github.io/posts/fpsstudy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://mazafrav.github.io/posts/fpsstudy/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="level-blocking-for-a-fps-horror-game">Level blocking for a FPS Horror game.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This level consists of three stages and it takes place in a building filled with your favorite generic zombies. The goal is to reach the parking lot situated at the bottom of the building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first part is the rooftop of the building where the player receives information about the context of the scene and his goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second part is the interior of the building, there are a couple of npcs that give hints to the player, along with keys, locked doors and pickups needed to move forward.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
